Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods for a class, including constructors with different parameter lists (constructors overloading). This is a common practice in Java to provide different ways of creating objects with different initializations, so that every constructor can perform a different task.
